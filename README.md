#Before running the code, you need to download some installation packages: pip install scipy spectral scikit-learn scikit-image opencv-python torch-geometric，seaborn "numpy<2" --upgrade einops

##The UP and SA datasets are too large and can be downloaded here: https://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes
